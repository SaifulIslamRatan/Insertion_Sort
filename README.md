# Insertion_Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration. Insertion sort works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game. We assume that the first card is already sorted then, we select an unsorted card.
